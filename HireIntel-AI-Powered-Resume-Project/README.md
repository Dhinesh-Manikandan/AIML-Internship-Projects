# AI-Powered Resume Ranker – Semantic Matching Prototype  

This project is a **basic-level internship project** that demonstrates how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** can be used to assist in **automating resume screening**. The system ranks resumes against a given job description using **TF-IDF** and **Sentence Transformers** for semantic similarity scoring.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Upload resumes and job descriptions for analysis  
- Extract and preprocess text from PDF/DOCX files  
- Compute similarity using **TF-IDF** and **Sentence Transformers**  
- Rank resumes by relevance score  
- Interactive **Gradio web app** for easy usage  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **SpaCy** – text preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – TF-IDF vectorization  
- **Sentence Transformers** – semantic similarity  
- **Gradio** – UI for uploading and ranking resumes
